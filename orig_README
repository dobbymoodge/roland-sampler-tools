    This package includes the following:

	rs12.h		the deciphered (S-550) sample-disk format
	raw8.c		convert sample data to an 8-bit raw sample file
	samprint.c	detailed sample-disk dump in ASCII
	samlabel.c	print sample-disk label and contents

    The sources are copyrighted but freely distributable for your own
    non-comercial use.  Thanks to Pete Lyall for samdisk so that this
    could be done.

    I'd be interested in seeing the following:
	1) an Amiga 8SVX converter
